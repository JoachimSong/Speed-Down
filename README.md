## Gameplay

You can only maneuver your character to move left and right and cannot actively jump. Your goal is to find the right moment to move to the platform below and avoid touching the spikes on the ceiling. In the process, you need to avoid various traps and can pick up props to gain buffs. The longer you hold on, the higher the score you get.

## Features

- **Fan platform**: the character will jump when stepping on it.
- **Grey platform**: the platform will disappear after the character steps on it for 3 seconds.
- **Rotating Platform**: the platform will tilt when the character steps on it, but there is an angle limit.
- **Chain spiked ball**: it will sway left and right, and the character will die if touches it.
- **Orange**: The character can gain the ability to fall slowly for 5 seconds after touching an orange, but will jump higher after stepping on the fan platforms.
- **As time goes by, the platform will rise faster!**

## Installation
